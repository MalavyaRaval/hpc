# HPC

This is a repo for one of my projects for High PErformance Computing.

## Tools and Skills used :- 

● C++, OpenMP, CUDA, MPI, LIKWID, HPC, performance analysis, performance optimization, parallel
programming, LaTeX, Python, matplotlib
## What did you do :- 

● Analyzing and improving memory and cache utilization of numerical codes using metrics like runtime, speedup,
percent of peak memory bandwidth, average memory latency, L2/L3 cache access counters, instruction counts.  
● Developed shared-memory parallel numerical and image analysis codes for multi-core CPUs and many-core
GPUs using C++, CUDA, MPI, OpenMP, and OpenMP with device offload  
● Technical writing using LaTeX to the performance problem being studied, the implementation and approach, the
methodology for testing and evaluation, and methodical evaluation of experimental results  
● Code development and performance analysis on Perlmutter at NERSC, an HPE Cray Shasta platform,
GPU-accelerated supercomputer comprised of 3,072 CPU-only and 1,792 GPU-accelerated nodes
